# RaspberryRailroad
My Son has a train table, I am a programmer by trade (And a bit of a technophile), therefore combining the Raspberry PI the train 
table seemed to be a good fit.

I am writing this to be easy to use (P2), and stable (P0) and fast (P1).

As I get further along I will post wiring diagrams of what I am doing, so others can copy or expand upon it.

Right now I am working on 2 major things:
1. Task and a Task Library to control things like LEDs, Servo Motors, etc
2. An occupancy library that can read from sensors to detect when a section of track is occupied and run tasks (Lower cross gates, blink
LEDs, etc.)
